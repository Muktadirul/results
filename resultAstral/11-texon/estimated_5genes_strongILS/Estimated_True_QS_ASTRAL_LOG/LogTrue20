================== ASTRAL ===================== 

This is ASTRAL version 5.5.12
Gene trees are treated as unrooted
5 trees read from dataset/11-texon/estimated_5genes_strongILS/sp_tree/Rep12_5genes
Scoring dataset/11-texon/estimated_5genes_strongILS/model/model_tree_trimmed
Scoring: 1 trees
Number of taxa: 11 (11 species)
Taxa: [4, 8, 5, 10, 9, 7, 6, 11, 2, 3, 1]
Taxon occupancy: {11=5, 1=5, 2=5, 3=5, 4=5, 5=5, 6=5, 7=5, 8=5, 9=5, 10=5}
