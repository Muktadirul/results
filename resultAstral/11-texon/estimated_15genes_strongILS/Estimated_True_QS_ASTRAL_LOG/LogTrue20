================== ASTRAL ===================== 

This is ASTRAL version 5.5.12
Gene trees are treated as unrooted
15 trees read from dataset/11-texon/estimated_15genes_strongILS/sp_tree/Rep14_15genes
Scoring dataset/11-texon/estimated_15genes_strongILS/model/model_tree_trimmed
Scoring: 1 trees
Number of taxa: 11 (11 species)
Taxa: [3, 4, 2, 11, 8, 9, 6, 7, 5, 10, 1]
