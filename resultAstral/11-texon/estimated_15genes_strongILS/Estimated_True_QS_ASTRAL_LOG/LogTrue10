================== ASTRAL ===================== 

This is ASTRAL version 5.5.12
Gene trees are treated as unrooted
15 trees read from dataset/11-texon/estimated_15genes_strongILS/sp_tree/Rep1_15genes
Scoring dataset/11-texon/estimated_15genes_strongILS/model/model_tree_trimmed
Scoring: 1 trees
Number of taxa: 11 (11 species)
Taxa: [11, 8, 6, 5, 9, 10, 7, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Taxon occupancy: {11=15, 1=15, 2=15, 3=15, 4=15, 5=15, 6=15, 7=15, 8=15, 9=15, 10=15}
